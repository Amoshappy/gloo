Gloo is a feature-rich, Kubernetes-native ingress controller, and next-generation API gateway.
Gloo is exceptional in its function-level routing; its support for legacy apps, microservices and serverless;
its discovery capabilities; its numerous features; and its tight integration with leading open-source projects.
Gloo is uniquely designed to support hybrid applications, in which multiple technologies, architectures, protocols,
and clouds can coexist.
